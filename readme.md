 # Sorting algorithms
 These are algorithms I have learnt in my computer science degree, and implemented. 
 <br>
 ### Currently available algorithms
 - counting sort
 
 ### I'm working on
 - Merge sort
 - Quick sort
 - Insertion sort
 - Selection sort
 - Radix sort
 
 If you have any ideas of other sorting algorithms for me to implement, please let me know. 
 
 My plan is to implement these algorithms in a few different languages, so they are accessible to anyone.
